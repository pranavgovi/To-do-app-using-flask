# To-do-app-using-flask
This app is a simple to do list app used to create ,read, delete and update tasks using flask. This project does'nt have proper UI . I mainly implemented this project to understand CRUD features in flask.
Many users can add tasks individually. They can also delete and update tasks.
Flask is used a as a backend.
Templates are created using html.
Sqlite database is used.
